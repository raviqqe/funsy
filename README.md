# Functional System Modelling Diagram
(I just wanna call it Funsy.)

## Motivation

* Making a practical design diagram for software in purely functional
  programming languages


## Features

("system" is the software you design in this section)

* Separation of systems and the world which they affects
* Separation of system's function and state
* friendly with _DFD_ (_Data Flow Diagram_)


### Merits


### Demerits


## Usage

1. Break down the system which you design by _DFD_ to make each processes in it
  small enough to apply **Funsy**.
2. Design each processes by applying **Funsy**. 
3. Design details of the functions in them.
4. Define the data types transfered among each functions.
