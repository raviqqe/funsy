* DFD (Data Flow Diagram)

  Each processes in DFD can have their states utilizing files or databases.
  So, it is difficult to separate the system's procedure and states with it.

* Diagrams of Flow-based Programming

  This is nearly what is needed. But, it allows loops of data flow in its
  diagrams to design interactive systems, which can result in complicated
  design.
