* DFD (Data Flow Diagram)

  Each processes in DFD can have their states utilizing files or databases.
  So, it is difficult to separate the system's procedure and states with it,
  which is preferred in functional programming languages.

* Diagrams of Flow-based Programming

  This is nearly what is needed. But, it allows loops of data flow in its
  diagrams to design interactive systems, which can result in producing
  complicated ones.
