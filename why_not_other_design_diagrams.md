* _DFD_ (_Data Flow Diagram_)
  Each processes in DFD can have their states utilizing files or databases.
  So, it is difficult to separate the system's procedure and states with it.
* _Flow-based Programming_ 
  This is nearly what is needed. But, it allows loops of data flow in its
  diagrams to design interactive systems, which can result in complicated
  design.
